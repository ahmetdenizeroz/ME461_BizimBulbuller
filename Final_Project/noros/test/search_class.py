class SearchClass:
    """
    A simple A* grid search algorithm implementation that also takes into account:
      - Robot orientation (in multiples of 90 degrees)
      - Movement and rotation costs
      - Optional cell rewards/penalties
      - Weight factors for time vs. reward

    Usage (basic):
        1. Initialize the class.
        2. Set grid dimensions using `set_grid_dimensions(rows, cols)`.
        3. (Optional) Add obstacles using `add_obstacle(row, col)`.
        4. (Optional) Set speeds, rewards, etc.
        5. Call `find_path(start, goal, initial_direction=0)` to retrieve the path.

    Attributes:
        rows (int): Number of rows in the grid.
        cols (int): Number of columns in the grid.
        obstacles (set): Set of cells (row, col) that are blocked.
        linear_speed (float): Robot's linear speed (cells per unit time).
        rotation_speed (float): Time cost for a 90-degree rotation.
        w_time (float): Weight factor for time cost in the cost function.
        w_reward (float): Weight factor for reward in the cost function.
        cell_rewards (dict): A dictionary mapping (row, col) -> reward value.
